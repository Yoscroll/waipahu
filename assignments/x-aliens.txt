// Waipahu 2016 - Aliens Exercise

  Students practice if conditionals.

  Worth one point for pushing to github.
  If they are working in groups or pair programing both students must push to git hub.

// LET'S GET STARTED!!

Aliens are invading!

// Create Variables
There are blue, green, and red aliens.
The total amount of aliens there are is 10,000.


// Set up Conditional

First, check if there are 10,000 aliens.

Then, if there are more than 5,000 green aliens, console.log "Ugh, why are they so ugly?"

If there are more than a total of 8,000 green and red aliens combined, console.log "No, why?????"

If there are not more than 3000 red and blue aliens combined, console.log
"Okay, this seems somewhat manageable. Wait no, we're still dead..."

You may assign the alien amounts yourself, but the total must add up to ten thousand!
