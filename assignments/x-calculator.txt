  The First Parameter of the function will be the type of calculation ie. Add or Subtract or Multiply or Divide.

  The Second Parameter will be the first value that the calculator will use in the calculation

  The Third Parameter will be the second value that the calculator will use in the calculation

  Console log the result of the calculation


  Notes:
