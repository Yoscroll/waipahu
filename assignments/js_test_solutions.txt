  js_test_solutions exercise was to introduce a git branching as well as giving the solutions for the Javascript test given Nov. 23, 2016

  This assignment is worth one point for creating and pushing to branch

Progression:

Step one: Introduce Branches in Git/Github

  Branches - Branches are used to develop features isolated from each other. The master branch is the "default" branch when you create a repository. Use other branches for development and merge them back to the master branch upon completion.


Step two: Set up solutions branch

  Inside test_review folder create a branch
    git branch solutions
    git checkout solutions

    or git checkout -b solutions

  Open your js_test_review.js in sublime text

  Make a comment or change in the test file and save

  git checkout master

  Observe what happens to the test file. Your changes should not be shown.
   -- this is to demonstrate the difference between master and the newly created branches


Step three: Live code the test solutions

  When complete save.

  git add [file].js
  git commit -m "solutions"
  git push --set-upstream origin solutions
