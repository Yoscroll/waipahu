// Waipahu 2016 Block Family

  Students learn responsive design and break points

  Project was adjusted to only CSS and inspired from:
  https://github.com/devleague/block-family

  Note: Some students did not use Media Queries but inline block to make blocks responsive.

  For Future instructors, media queries are not exactly optional here. Moving forward if the students choose no to use MQ, do not give full credit.
